# Assignment 5: Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis Implementation

## Instructions
Based on **Lyon, Chapter 13, Further Explorations**.

1. **Enhance `dynstoch~`:**
   - Implement additional **random distributions** beyond the uniform distribution as described by Serra.
   - Explore variations proposed by **Luque** and implement one of his proposed variations.

2. **Document Your Implementation:**
   - Clearly specify in your code comments:
     - Which **distributions** you are implementing.
     - The **variation** you selected and implemented.

3. **Create a Pd-Style Help File:**
   - The help file should:
     - Demonstrate the functionality of the **`dynstoch~`** object.
     - Provide clear examples of how to use your additions.
