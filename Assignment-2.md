# Assignment 2: Setting Phase in an Oscillator

## Instructions
Based on **Lyon, Chapter 5, Exercise 2**.

1. **Modify `oscil~`:**
   - Add a second, signal-only inlet to control phase directly.
   - This functionality can be used for **phase modulation**.
   - Ensure you handle and correct for **bad user input** to prevent errors.

2. **Create a Pd-Style Help File:**
   - Implement a **help file** for your `oscil~` object.
   - The help file should:
     - Demonstrate the usage of the second inlet.
     - Provide clear examples and explanations for its functionality.
