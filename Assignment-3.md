# Assignment 3: Building a Digital Filter for a Buffer

## Instructions
Based on **Lyon, Chapter 7, Exercise 6**.

1. **Find a Resonant Filter Formula:**
   - Locate a formula for a **resonant filter** in a DSP textbook or another reliable source.

2. **Implement the Filter:**
   - Write a method that applies this resonant filter to a buffer.
   - Provide user access to the following parameters:
     - **Center Frequency**
     - **Resonance**
   - Implement this functionality within the **`bed`** object.

3. **Create a Pd-Style Help File:**
   - Include a help file that demonstrates:
     - The implementation of the **`bed`** object.
     - The functionality and usage of the **resonant filter**.
     - Clear examples and explanations for user interaction.
